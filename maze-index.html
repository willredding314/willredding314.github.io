           The Random Maze Generator was created in April of 2021, 
           made entirely from Java. The project constructs random 
           mazes and can solve and display the solutions in many different
           ways. At the start of the program (img 1), the user has a fully
           blocked grid, with each blockage being broken and animated
           using Kruskal's algorithm for random minimum spanning trees. 
           After the maze construction is finished (img 2), the program
           will automatically solve the maze using a depth-first search
           algorithm. Using a breadth first search or manually solving the 
           maze is also an available option using keyboard commands. As the Maze
           is being solved, the program shows all squares that have already been 
           searched, as well as signifying the leading square (img 3). There are 
           additional options for animating the distance from the start or the
           distance from the finish of each cell in the maze. Upon finishing the 
           maze, the final path is revealed with a blue stripe (img 4).
