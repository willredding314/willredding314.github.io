        <h3>Hi there! I'm Will!</h3>
        <p>I'm currently a sophomore at Northeastern University,
            studying Computer Science with a concentration in AI. 
            This site is serving as my portfolio 
            website for the coming years as I develop more projects 
            and expand my skills. 
        </p>
        <p>Some information about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I have done most of my work in Java (as you'll see in the projects tab), but 
                like to play around with some web development too. This semester I'll also be learning C
                through my course work.
            </li>
            <li>
                My interests include tennis, Dungeons and Dragons 
                (lmk if you need a player or a DM), and making chili!
            </li>
            <li>
                I hope to be on the CBS TV show Big Brother one day.
            </li>
